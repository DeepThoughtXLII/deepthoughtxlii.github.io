        <h2>Hello.</h2>
            
        <p>I am currently a student at Saxion Hogeschool in Enschede studying Creative Media and Game Technologies in the Engineering track in order to become a Game Programmer. 
        </p>

        <p>Since I was a kid I have always been fascinated by Games and the way they tell stories and when I finally encountered the wonders of coding in my 7th Grade Computer Science elective I started to dream of making games myself.</p>

        <p>Since then I have learned by myself and in my courses how to work with Unity and also gathered experience working in a team on a game which has taught me what designers and artist struggle with and getting used to finding creative solutions for unexpected problems coming up during the project time. I do my best for every project I take part in.</p>
