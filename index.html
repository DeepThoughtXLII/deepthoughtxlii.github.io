                <h2>Hello.</h2>

                <p>I just finished my minor in Game Lab at OAMK in Oulu, Finland as part of my study Creative
                    Media and Game Technologies in the Engineering track in order to become a Game Programmer.
                </p>

                <p>Since I was a kid I have always been fascinated by Games and the way they tell stories and when I
                    finally encountered the wonders of coding in my 7th Grade Computer Science elective I started to
                    dream of making games myself.</p>

                <p>Now I am working hard to make that dream come true and doing my best to learn a lot and gather as
                    much experience as I can.</p>

                    <p>Pass The Gas is an mobile game and an Idle-Tycoon with the objective of building and managing your own Space Gas Station. 
                        The Player can build and upgrade structures and gather special resources in a small risk/reward game that we called "Space Expeditions".

                    <p>It was a project I worked on with a group of 7 people during my minor abroad in Finland. 
                        I was mainly responsible for the <mark>behaviour of the aliens</mark>, walking around and generating income,
                         for everything that had to with the <mark>different buildings and their individual functions</mark> and the <mark>upgrade system</mark>.
                          I also did work on <mark>integrating the UI</mark> into the game together with another developer 
                        and took care of <mark>connecting the Main Island with the Space Expedition</mark>. Aside from that I did some <mark>basic events with firebase</mark> and helped where I could when smaller Issues happened elsewhere
                    and took part in discussing gameplay changes, planning testing sessions and documenting the development progress.</p>
                   <br>
                    <p>At this point Pass The Gas is released on Play Store and we are planning on continuing development the best we can next to our own projects/studies.</p>

                    <p>Heavensfall is a short 2-4 player auto-aim shooter in which players must survive multiple waves of enemies together. Every enemy killed, awards XP and after certain milestones of XP gained, Players level up.
                        A hidden objective of the game is to try to keep the levels of all players more or less even, since any player that kills disproportionally more enemies than their allies
                        becomes corrupted by their deeds and must now be defeated by their former friends.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It was a game I worked on with 5 other people for a multiplayer game festival. The thought was to create a game that was short, 
                        easy to pick up for players of all ages and experience levels and still fun for everyone. In order to not have any troubles with keeping track of
                        controllers during the festival, we made it possible for players to scan a QR code and join the game over websockets, using their phones as controllers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During the 8 weeks of development I was responsible for the <mark>networking of the web controllers</mark> and in general making the <mark>multiplayer aspect</mark> work properly.
                        I also worked on <mark>player levels and XP</mark>, the <mark>gameplay loop</mark> with different endings, <mark>in unity</mark>, 
                        making the <mark> 3D environment work with the 2D characters on the camera</mark>, the <mark>final boss fight<mark> and on solving various bugs that came up during development.

                    <p>HP but UWU is a small project that was born from an assignment that I had to complete for a C++ course. 
                        The task was to create a simplefied round-based combat game similar to pokemon with just C++ and the SFML library.
                        I had some pixel art that I had done quickly a while ago and just decided to make use of it for this assignment.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The gameplay is pretty simple. You choose one of three characters and then you fight Voldemort(but uwu). You take alternating turns choosing
                        an action every turn. You have options to Attack(doing damage), Recover(50% to recover HP), Prepare(take less damage next turn) or Cast Magic(do sanity damage).
                        Voldemort(but uwu) will complete a random action every turn with a small chance to do nothing. All actions can be checked in the action log and 
                        every time Voldemort(but uwu) dies, he reaches a new form and the player gains 100 points. When the Player dies, the score gets logged into teh highscore file.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I had a lot of fun with this small project and especially working with C++ was nice. I hadn't done anything in C++ before
                        so it was certainly different, but I enjoyed it immensely once I got immersed in it. I have continued working on the project,
                        now and then just for fun and I still have plans to add small animations and sounds as well as add something for players
                        to input their own names into the highscore file. I have also long been considering a way to progress the character when defeating an enemy.
                        And adding more opponents instead of different versions of Voldemort(but uwu).

                        the sound, they are able to find a variety of buildings in downtown Enschede and use the camera to see
                        what the environment looked like many years ago as well as learn some interesting facts about what happened
                        and who lived at these places. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I worked on this project with a group of 5 people in Unity. I worked on the <mark>GPS integration with a custom map</mark> 
                        by researching and integrating the <mark><a class="link" href="https://www.mapbox.com/unity">Mapbox SDK</a></mark> and implemented the audio feedback. 
                        It works by the user entering an area of interest which then triggers a sound relating to the corresponding building.
                        Then the app changes the volume of the <mark>sound based on your distance to the actual building</mark>.

                    <p>PN was the first 'proper' game I programmed that wasn't just a very rough ugly prototype.
                      It was the firts group project after we'd had 2 months of coding classes, learning Processing.
                      The task was to create a short point&click game and we were inspired by the horror demo P.T. (Playable Trailer)
                    where (for those that don't know) you explore a hallway and everytime you leave a room things change around you.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>P.N. (Playable Nightmare) has 3(~4) different rooms. The player wakes up in a locked room with a big door
                        behind which they can hear someone else desperately asking to be let out. The player needs to try to find a door
                        and a key to get past teh extensive security of this heavy door. As the player finds things and explores different areas
                        other past areas change and finally there is a spooky reveal at the end.

                    <br>
                    <p>Looking back at this project, despite it having been a very stressful two weeks and remembering
                        all the issues we had with organizing and working in this group dynamic of artists, designers and programmers for the first time,
                        I still believe this was a very exiting project. I had so many doubts about choosing Programming as my specialization track
                        in this study, because I just didn't know if I could do it, but programming every day from morning to evening and figuring out
                        how to do all these things one by one, solving problems as they came up all on my own, it was just such a fun time and even if I got stuck
                        I always managed to get 'unstuck' again. After this project I just knew I really really wanted to try, because of all the things to do in
                        game development, making it all work was with code was magical. I was a wizard writing my own spells.
